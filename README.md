# 04_trees_in_rust
Implementations of simple binary tree, red-black tree and a state machine graph in Rust.

A. Binary tree: the simplest possible binary tree with a key-value pair. Key is hashable and therefore it's possible to sort the data as the binary tree restrictions require.
B. Red-black tree: a balanced version of the binary search tree in (A), which rebalances itself after each operation.
C. State Machine graph: a graph of several states and connections between them: graph starts in a certain state, and then follows the connections to other states to switch current state to a new one.
